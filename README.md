## 🧩 Problem Description

Briefly describe the problem you are addressing.  
- Students often make academic and career choices without clearly understanding industry requirements or their own skill gaps. This disconnect between education and real-world expectations leads to skill mismatch and reduced employability among graduates.

Explain the background and why this problem is relevant.
- Rapid changes in industry requirements and evolving job roles have made it difficult for traditional education systems to keep pace with current skill demands. Many students rely on limited guidance, outdated curricula, or incomplete information when choosing academic paths, resulting in a gap between what they learn and what employers expect. This problem is highly relevant today, as increasing competition in the job market and rising graduate unemployment highlight the urgent need to better align education, skills, and career choices with real-world industry needs.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Approach:
We propose a student-centric career guidance platform that bridges the gap between education and industry by combining real-time industry insights, skill mapping, and personalized guidance. The platform helps students explore career paths, understand required skills, and assess their current competencies.
How it solves the problem:
By clearly showing industry expectations, in-demand skills, and nearby job or internship opportunities, the solution enables students to make informed academic and career decisions. It highlights skill gaps early, allowing students to upskill before graduation, thereby reducing mismatch and improving employability.
Key idea behind the solution:
The core idea is to align students’ education choices with real-world industry needs through transparency, awareness, and early intervention—empowering students with the right information at the right time.

## 🖥️ Implementation Details

Overall workflow:
The platform begins by collecting basic user inputs such as academic background, interests, and career preferences. Based on this information, it maps suitable career paths and displays the corresponding industry-required skills. The system then compares these requirements with the user’s current skill set to identify gaps and recommends relevant learning resources and nearby job or internship opportunities.
Key features implemented:
Career path exploration aligned with current industry demands
Skill-gap analysis based on user inputs
Real-time display of nearby job and internship opportunities with direct links
User-friendly dashboard for clear visualisation of career options and progress
Challenges faced and how they were solved:
One major challenge was presenting complex career and skill data in a simple and understandable manner. This was addressed by using structured workflows and clear visual sections. Another challenge was ensuring the relevance of opportunities shown; this was handled by filtering and categorising job data based on location and skill requirements.
